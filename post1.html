                As IT pros around the world go all-out to support a workforce that's suddenly fully remote, many
                technology workers and companies are also joining efforts to alleviate the COVID-19 crisis in various
                ways, including developing products to combat the virus, tracking and predicting its spread, and
                protecting hospitals from cyberattacks.

                ViewSonic is offering up its Professional Development team to provide one-on-one online support for
                educators "with any learning initiatives they may have, including topics such as: distance learning as a
                whole, tools for distance learning, curriculum development, as well as video creation or conferencing
                for lessons," the company said in a statement.

                Remote and distance learning lessons are definitely different than inside the confines of a classroom,"
                said Blake Everhart, solution training manager at ViewSonic Americas. "As a former teacher, I understand
                there's sometimes a gap between learning the scope and sequence of the technology side that can match up
                with the lessons you want to teach. The ability to create and complete lessons, and how to filter
                through the many resources that are out there makes it tough to focus. That's why my team and I at
                ViewSonic are making ourselves available to help out and make things less overwhelming."
